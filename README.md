Content-Based Recommendation System
 
It is another type of recommendation system which works on the principle of similar content. If a user is watching a movie, then the system will check about other movies of similar content or the same genre of the movie the user is watching. There are various fundamentals attributes that are used to compute the similarity while checking about similar content. 
IMPLEMENTATION:
Cosine Similarity: Cosine of the angle between the two vectors of the item, vectors of A and B is calculated for imputing similarity. If the vectors are closer, then small will be the angle and large will be the cosine.
